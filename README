README file for project 'qemu_scripts'
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Assuming:
	1. you have a bunch of virtual disks into which you installed a bunch
	   VMs using Qemu
	2. each VM disk is in its own directory

If:
   you create a 'CONFIG' file in each directory, one for each VM

Then:
   you can use the scripts in this project to start the VMs and setup their
   networking



*****************************************************************************
CONFIG file

The required CONFIG file requires the following items:
	MACADDR
	IPBASE

The following items are optional in the CONFIG file:
	NOPWUSER
	VMMEM
	VMSMP
	USEGUI
	NETUSER


MACADDR:
	provide a unique MAC address for each VM
	e.g.
		MACADDR=DE:AD:BE:EF:00:nn

IPBASE:
	the base of the IP address you want this VM to use
	e.g.
		IPBASE=192.168.8.

NOPWUSER: (optional, used with qrun_cmd)
	a username from in the VM that doesn't require a pw

VMMEM: (optional)
	allows the user to specify a memory size, default 512M

VMSMP: (optional)
	allows a user to specify the SMP settings
	default: 1 core 1 thread (i.e. 1 cpu)

USEGUI: (optional)
	if defined and non-zero, assume the VM needs to run a GUI
	default: don't use a GUI (use cmdline only)

NETUSER: (optional)
	if defined and non-zero, use simple "user" networking
	default: use non-simple networking
